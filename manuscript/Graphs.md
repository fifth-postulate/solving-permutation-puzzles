# Graphs

The structure presented in the previous chapter is called a [_graph_][graph]. A
graph is a collection of objects called _vertices_ and there connections called
_edges_. Graphs are ubiquitous. The world wide web can be seen as a graphs as
well as social networks.

Graphs have various different representations. The table that listed the states
that could be reached from a given state of the wolf, sheep and cabbage puzzle
is one. It tells you if two vertices are neighbors.

Two others could be the _adjacency matrix_ and the _incidence matrix_.
