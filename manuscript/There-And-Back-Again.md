# There and Back Again
With a little more bookkeeping during the orbit algorithm we can keep track of
some useful information. Most notably a standard permutation that brought the
base to the are certain point in the orbit.

The only thing that needs to be changed is to keep track of the first known
permutation that brings the base to the new number found to be in the orbit. We
call such a permutation a _transversal_.
Specifically augment the algorithm with the following steps

1. Create a transversals list and initialize it with the identity permutation.
2. For every number you add to the orbit list, also add the permutation that
   brought the base to this number to the transversal list.

## Exercises
1. Determine the transversals for the orbit of `0` under the group generated by
```
[
  0 1 2 3
  1 0 2 3
]
```

and

```
[
  0 1 2 3
  0 1 3 2
]
```

## Implementations
Augment the orbit algorithm to also determine transversals.
