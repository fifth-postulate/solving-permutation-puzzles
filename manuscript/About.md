# What this book is all about

If you are reading this book you probably like puzzles, permutation puzzles in
particular. But you could be skeptical about what this book will bring you. This
chapter is intended to give you a good description of the books intentions.

We are going to use mathematics to solve permutation puzzle, but we are going to
do that in a way that is very practical. The goal is to take any permutation
puzzle, study it and figure out how to solve it in such a way that can be
memorized.

The mathematics that we are going to learn along the way are
[graph theory][graph-theory] and [group theory][group-theory]. Graphs Theory
studies *graphs*. Graphs crop up everywhere if you now how to look. Groups is a
way to describe symmetries and their relations. They can be harnessed to solve
permutation puzzles. But we are not satisfied with a computer solving the
puzzle, we would like to get our hands dirty.

So we are going to use the computer to help us find solution paths that are
human accessible.
